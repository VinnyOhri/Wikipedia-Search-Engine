		upon successful compilation and execution, multiple index files are created in chunks of 5000 pages
	2. To merge the indexes, compile and run merge.java to merge to multiple index files(0-9a-z)
	3. Compile and run secondindex.java to create secondary index files
	4. Compile and run secondary.java and tertiary.java to create the index for title file

Running the queries:
